# OpenCV Basics Tutorials

This repository has a number of scripts that I wrote when I was learning OpenCV. These are completely copied from the following tutorials:

Scripts 1-6 follow and cover the first 7 chapters in the "[LEARN OPENCV in 3 HOURS with Python | Including 3xProjects | Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs)" video by [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI](https://www.youtube.com/@murtazasworkshop).

The remaining 2 scripts cover the corresponding chapters from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o
