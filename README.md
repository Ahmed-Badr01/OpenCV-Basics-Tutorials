# OpenCV Basics Tutorials

This repository has a number of scripts that I wrote when I was learning OpenCV. These are completely copied from the following tutorials:

- Scripts 1-6 follow and cover the first 7 chapters in the [LEARN OPENCV in 3 HOURS with Python | Including 3xProjects | Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs) video by [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI](https://www.youtube.com/@murtazasworkshop).

- The last script covers the corresponding chapters from [OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o) by freecodecamp.org, specifically, it covers the 2 sections between [1:12:53](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?t=4373) and [1:31:03](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?t=5463).
